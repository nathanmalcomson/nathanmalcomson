        <p>
          I completed a BA in English at the University of British Columbia. My honour's thesis was on contemporary readings of Shakespeare's much-maligned <i>Titus Andronicus</i>. Thinking about hermeneutics led me to develop an interest in the philosophy of language, specifically in what makes it the case that we mean what we do by our words. I started reading Davidson and Wittgenstein on my own and never looked back. I did an MA in Philosophy at York University, Toronto, and am now pursuing my PhD at York. With two young boys, most of my non-philosophy time is spent building Lego structures and mediating territory disputes. In those rare moments of free time, I enjoy hiking, boardgames, and reading fiction (Dostoyevsky and Robert Jordan are personal favourites).
