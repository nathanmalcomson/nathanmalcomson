          My dissertation pursues an act-based account of meaning, along the
          lines of Scott Soames' <i>What is Meaning?</i> and
          <i>Rethinking Language, Mind, and Meaning</i> as well as Peter Hanks'
          <i>Propositional Content</i>. However, I depart from both Soames and
          Hanks at important junctures. An act-based account of meaning, as I
          understand it, is a position in meta-semantics: it's an attempt to
          articulate the facts by virtue of which we mean what we do by our
          words. While one might justifiably think of act-based accounts as a
          species of use theories of meaning, I think there are distinct
          explanatory advantages to making a robust and explicit appeal to the
          nature and shape of intentional action in an account of meaning.

          I have other interests in the philosophy of language as well. Most
          notably, I am working on motivating an anti-conventional literalism
          which I think one finds in the work of Davidson. That is is to say, I
          am interested in arguing against various forms of contextualism and
          against social conventionalism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of the philosophy of language, I have interests in the
          philosophy of action and in the philosophy of religion, as well as an
          abiding interest in the works and influence of both Wittgenstein and
          Anscombe.
