                  I am currently pursuing a PhD at York University, under the
                  supervision of Claudine Verheggen. My dissertation develops an
                  act-based account of meaning, along the lines of Scott
                  Soames' <i>What is Meaning?</i> (2010) and <i
                    >Rethinking Language, Mind, and Meaning</i
                  >
                  (2015) as well as Peter Hanks' <i>Propositional Content</i>
                  (2015). However, while Soames and Hanks motivate their
                  accounts with the problem of the unity of the proposition, I
                  think that we find a better motivation for an act-based
                  account of meaning in Wittgenstein's rule-following
                  considerations. When we begin with Wittgestein's 'paradox'
                  (in Investigations #201), which applies to individual words
                  and not just whole propositions, there is reason to think that
                  our account of meaning should be act-based all the way down,
                  that it should be non-reductive, and that it should be
                  holistic. While one might justifiably think of act-based
                  accounts as a species of use theories of meaning, there are
                  distinct explanatory advantages to making a robust and
                  explicit appeal to the nature and shape of intentional action
                  in an account of meaning.

                  I have other interests in the philosophy of language as well.
                  Most notably, I am working on defending anti-conventional
                  literalism, the position that many of a speaker's words have
                  their 'literal' meanings fixed in advance of their utterance
                  but not by social conventions. Part of this project involves
                  arguing that Davidson developed just such a view across his
                  work (though, particularly in his paper "A Nice Derangement of
                  Epitaphs").
                </p>

                  Outside of the philosophy of language, I have interests in the
                  philosophy of action and in the philosophy of religion, as
                  well as an abiding interest in the history of analytic
                  philosophy.
