                <p>
                  I completed a BA in English at the University of British
                  Columbia. My honour's thesis was on contemporary readings of
                  Shakespeare's much-maligned <i>Titus Andronicus</i>. Thinking
                  about hermeneutics led me to develop an interest in the
                  philosophy of language, specifically in what makes it the case
                  that we mean what we do by our words. I started reading
                  Davidson and Wittgenstein on my own and never looked back. I
                  did an MA in Philosophy at York University, Toronto, and am
                  now pursuing my PhD at York. With two young boys, most of my
                  non-philosophy time is spent building Lego structures and
                  mediating territory disputes. In those rare moments of free
                  time, I enjoy hiking, boardgames, and reading fiction
                  (Dostoyevsky and Robert Jordan are personal favourites).
